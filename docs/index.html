<h2 id="solution-1">Solution:</h2>

<h3 id="introducing_smartshoppingcartwithautomaticbillsystem_">Introducing <em>smart shopping cart with automatic bill system</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>The shopper just have to scan the item before adding it into the cart.</li>

<li>This cart carries its own scanning device as a part of the cart.</li>

<li>Then the billing will be done automatically.</li>

<li>So that customer can pay the bill at the dedicated exit.</li>

<li>Shopper can&#39;t put an item without scanning ,it will be monitered in our system.</li>

<li>Shopper can remove any item ,the item will be removed from the bill also in our system</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="furtherintoproblem">Further into problem:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Shopper have to read discount flyers at shop and it takes time.</li>

<li>If shopper can notified about discounts before the going to supermarket both audience are benefited.</li>

<li>Online-ordering system(home delivery /order before you go to supermarket then just pay and take on the way home(No delivery charges))</li>

<li>Checking price list before go to the supermarket .</li>

<li>Make the to-buy-list before go to the supermarket.</li>

<li>Misplacement of bills (Method to save recent transactions)</li>

<li>Vouchers/tokens order system.</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve that problem we are going to introduce an <em>app.</em></p>

<h3 id="featuresofourapp">Features of our app-:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Customer User Account</li>

<li>Price lists</li>

<li>To-buy lists/online ordering</li>

<li>Discounts/Promotions notifications</li>

<li>Recent shopping activities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whendesigningthesmartshoppingcartattentionwaspaidtofollowingaspects">When designing the smart shopping cart, attention was paid to following aspects.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Customer&#39;s convenience</li>

<li>Reliable monitoring of the customer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1)For Customer&#39;s convenience:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The procedure the customer has to follow is not much deviated from the traditional method used in super-markets.</li>

<li>If customer forgets to scan it, he would be reminded (with the use of an alarm)</li>

<li>Multiple payment methods</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2)Reliable monitoring of the customer:</strong></p>

<p>The following situations are handled using a combination of weight sensors and laser sensors.</p>

<p><strong>- customer add/remove the item to the cart without scanning:</strong> Laser interrupted &amp; weight in the cart does not match the calculated weight in the bill</p>

<p><strong>- customer scanned the item ,but not added to the cart :</strong> Laser interrupted &amp; weight in the cart does not match the calculated weight in the bill</p>

<p>Two way monitoring system (laser and weight) therefore increases the accuracy of the shopping process.
